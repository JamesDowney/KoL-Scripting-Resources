This document is a list of commonly used scripts for community service ascensions in KoL. Most of them are meant for 1-day, loop-style HCCS--that is, minimizing resource use rather than turncount. Some are not: they are meant for two-day, or for speed, or for something else entirely. Most of these are written in typescript, which is then compiled into javascript for use by kolmafia. A few are written in ash, which conveniently does not need to be compiled.

CS scripts tend to be extraordinarily personal. Because the path rewards owning a long tail of marginal IotMs, and each user's greenboxen are slightly different, scripts will often fail for those other than their single intended user.
